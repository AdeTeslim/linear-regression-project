# Linear Regression Project

This project implements Linear Regression using scikit-learn to predict a continuous outcome based on input features. It demonstrates data exploration, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are to:

* Load and explore a dataset
* Visualize the data distribution and relationships
* Train a Linear Regression model
* Evaluate the model using regression metrics

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash

├── Linear_Regression_Project.ipynb     # Jupyter notebook with linear regression workflow
├── README.md                           # Project documentation
```

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using standard regression metrics:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R-squared Score (R²)

Visualizations such as scatter plots and regression lines are included to provide insight into model performance.
